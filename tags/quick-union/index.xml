      <description>Understood Quick-Find algorithm is too slow if we have many union operations. We have to design a new algorithm to do better, let&amp;#8217;s use a lazy approach where we try to avoid doing work until we have to:
we could think the array as a set of trees where each entry contains a reference to its parent in the tree. Each element of the array has associated with it a root and we can say that two elements are connected if they have the same root.</description>
