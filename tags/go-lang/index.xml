      <description>Understood Quick-Find algorithm is too slow if we have many union operations. We have to design a new algorithm to do better, let&amp;#8217;s use a lazy approach where we try to avoid doing work until we have to:
we could think the array as a set of trees where each entry contains a reference to its parent in the tree. Each element of the array has associated with it a root and we can say that two elements are connected if they have the same root.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;#8217;s assume our object can be identified by an integer number, we can use an integer Array as data structure for our solution (id[]) . In Quick-Find weÂ consider two sites p and q are in the same component if id[p] is equal do id[q].
The initQuickFindUF function allocates the zeroed array and assign the slice that refers to that array to Elements; then go through it and set the value corresponding to each index ( *Elements[i] = i *).</description>
